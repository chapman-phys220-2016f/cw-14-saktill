**Authors:** Sakthi Kasthurirengan and Will Parker

**Due date:** 2016/12/6

## Specification

Complete the following exercise in a Jupyter notebook ```GHCND.ipynb```. Using the pandas library, import the csv data file in this repository and explore the data file. The documentation GHCND_documentation.pdf may be helpful. In your notebook, do a study of the data reported by 1 particular station of your choice (that has interesting data). Plot the minimum and maximum temperatures over the reported ranges. Plot the recorded rainfall only in the month of June, 2015. Explain your findings in your notebook.

## Assessment

The review of pandas was very useful and necessary. Really wish we could've had more time to explore all of its capabilities. Also interesting to see some of this real world data and how its stored.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Saktill
